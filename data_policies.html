                            <p>The role of GOPY Platform is to support the commissioning of SOCIAL DIALONGES
                                includes and subjects to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and related fields,
                                so that valuable public resources secure the best possible outcomes for enterprises,
                                suppliers, government, NGOs and workers. This policy is important because it will
                                help the people who participate in the GOPY Platform to understand how to look after
                                the information they need to do/support their jobs, and to protect this information
                                on behalf of them.</p>
                            <h3 id="PURPOSE">2. PURPOSE</h3>
                            <p>Information is a vital asset. It plays a key part in ensuring the efficient management of
                                service planning, resources and performance management. It is therefore of paramount
                                importance to ensure that information is efficiently managed, and that appropriate
                                policies, procedures and management accountability and structures provide a robust
                                governance framework for information management. </p>

                            <p>Data Security and Protection governs how the GOPY handles information about users, staff,
                                clients, partners and all related data on GOPY Platform, with particular consideration
                                of personal and confidential information. Without access to information it would be
                                impossible to provide quality data and good corporate governance. A robust governance
                                framework needs to be in place to manage this vital asset, providing a consistent way to
                                deal with the many different information handling requirements including: </p>

                            <p>The GOPY recognizes the need for an appropriate balance between openness and
                                confidentiality in the management and use of information. The GOPY fully supports the
                                principles of corporate governance and recognizes its public accountability, but equally
                                places importance on confidentiality and the security arrangements to safeguard
                                information. The GOPY also recognizes the need to share information in a controlled

                                monitored by the Data Security & Assurance Working Group.</p>

                            <p>Compliance with the Data Security and Protection Toolkit will be assessed by NHS Digital
                                including a review of evidence, as part of the GOPY performance assessment. </p>

                            <p>The GOPY will ensure that Data Security and Protection is part of its annual cycle of
                                internal audit. The results of audits will be reported to the Data Security & Assurance
                                Working Group along with relevant action plans which they will monitor. Reports will
                                also be provided to the Integrated Governance and Quality Committee. </p>

                            <p>Compliance with the GOPY policies is stipulated in staff contracts of employment. If
                                staff members are unable to follow the GOPY policies or the policy requirements cannot
                                be applied in a specific set of circumstances, this must be immediately reported to the
                                Line Manager, who should take appropriate action. Any non-compliance with the GOPY
                                policies or failure to report non-compliance may be treated as a disciplinary offence.
                                Where noncompliance related to partner organizations and third party organizations, this
                                will be handled in accordance with contractual agreements and data sharing agreements.
