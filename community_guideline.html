                                <p>We take our role very seriously by keeping abuse off our service. That's why we have
                                    developed a set of Community Standards that outlines what is and is not allowed on
                                    GOPY. Our standards apply to all types of content worldwide. These are comprehensive
                                    standards by which, for example, content that is not viewed as hate speech still can
                                    be removed for violating our policy.</p>
                                <p>The goal of Community Standards is to create a safe environment which encourages
                                    everyone to express themselves . We've carefully crafted our policies based on
                                    information from communities and experts in areas like technology and public safety.
                                    Our policy also stems from the following principles:</p>
                                <p>Safety: Everyone needs to feel safe in order to build a strong community. We're
                                    committed to removing any content that promotes harmful real-world behavior,
                                    including (but not limited to) physical, financial, and emotional harm.</p>
                                <p>Voice: Our mission is to captivate diverse perspectives. We prioritize displaying
                                    content, even if some people disagree, unless removing it might prevent a particular
                                    hazard. Furthermore, we will allow content that may violate our standards if we
                                    believe the content is credible, meaningful, or important to the public interest. We
                                    only do this after carefully consider the public benefit of the content against the
                                    risk of real-world harm.</p>
                                <p>Fairness: Our communities are global and diverse and so are our policies. We've
                                    consistently and fairly applied them to a community spanning many regions, cultures,
                                    and languages. As a result, sometimes our Community Standards may not be as clear as
                                    we desire, leading to results contrary to our underlying purposes. For that reason,
                                    in some cases which we are given more context, decisions will be made based on the
                                    spirit of the policy rather than literal sense. </p>
                                <p>Everyone on GOPY plays an important role in keeping this platform safe and
                                    respectful. We require everyone to share, participate responsibly and inform us when
                                    seeing something that might violate our Community Standards. We make it easy for
                                    people to report potentially infringing content, including pages, groups, profile
                                    pages, personal content and / or comments for our review. </p>
                                <p>The consequences of violating our Community Standards will vary depending on the
                                    severity of the violation and the person's history on the platform. For example, we
                                    will give warning for first time violator, but if they continue to violate our
                                    policies, we may limit their ability to post to GOPY or disable their profile. We
                                    may also notify law enforcement when we believe there is a real danger of physical
                                    harm or a direct threat to the safety of the community.</p>
                                <p>Our community standards serve as a communication guide on GOPY. We will continue to
                                    develop these standards over time. In that spirit, we ask members of the GOPY
                                    community to adhere to these principles.</p>

                                <h3>Section 1: Violence and Criminal Behavior</h3>
                                <h4 id="violenceandincitement">1. Violence and Incitement </h4>

                                <p>Policy Rationale</p>

                                <p>It is our aim to prevent potential real-world hazards associated with content on
                                    GOPY. Although we understand that people often express disdain or disagreement by
                                    threatening or pretending to appeal to violence, we will remove language that incite
                                    or facilitate violent behavior. We remove content, disable accounts, and cooperate
                                    with law enforcement when we believe there is a genuine risk of physical harm or a
                                    direct threat to the safety of the community. We also try to consider language and
                                    context to distinguish unintentional statements from content that constitutes a
                                    potential threat to the safety of the public or private. To determine whether a
                                    threat is possible, we may also look at additional information such as public
                                    visibility and the risks to their physical safety. </p>

                                <p>In some cases, we see aspirational or conditional threats directed at terrorists and
                                    other violent actors (e.g. Terrorists deserve to be killed), and we deem those non
                                    credible absent specific evidence to the contrary.</p>

                                <p>Do not post: </p>

                                <p>Threats that could lead to death (and other forms of high-severity violence)

                                    represent violence</p>

                                <p>Calls for high-severity violence including content where no target is specified but a

                                    represents violence</p>

                                <p>Content that requests or provides a service for hire to harm others ((e.g., hitmen,

                                <p>Policy Rationale</p>

                                <p>To encourage safety and compliance with common legal restrictions, we prohibit
                                    attempts by individuals, manufacturers, and retailers to purchase, sell, or trade
                                    non-medical drugs, pharmaceutical drugs, and marijuana. We also prohibit the
                                    purchase, sale, gifting, exchange, and transfer of firearms, including firearm parts
                                    or ammunition, between private individuals on GOPY. Some of these items are not
                                    regulated everywhere; however, because of the borderless nature of our community, we
                                    try to enforce our policies as consistently as possible. Firearm stores and online
                                    retailers may promote items available for sale off of our services as long as those
                                    retailers comply with all applicable laws and regulations. We allow discussions
                                    about sales of firearms and firearm parts in stores or by online retailers and
                                    advocating for changes to firearm regulation. Regulated goods that are not
                                    prohibited by our Community Guideliness may still be subject to the stricter Trade
                                    Policies we introduce.</p>

                                <p>Policy Rationale </p>

                                <p>In an effort to build a safe environment on GOPY, we will remove content that
                                    promotes suicide or self-injury, including some real-time descriptions and images
                                    that experts have warned against. We are able to induce others to perform the same
                                    behavior. Self-injury is defined as direct and intentional bodily injury, including
                                    self-amputation and eating disorder. We want GOPY to be a place where people can
                                    share experiences, raise awareness about these issues, and support each other.
                                    Therefore, we allow people to discuss suicide and self-injury.</p>

                                <p>We work with organizations around the world to assist people in distress. We also
                                    speak with suicide and self-injury experts to get information for our policies and
                                    practices. For example, experts have advised us not to take live videos of
                                    self-injuring behavior, as relatives and authorities will have the opportunity to
                                    help or provide resources.</p>

                                <p>Instead, we will remove any content that identifies and targets victims or survivors
                                    of self-injury or suicide, whether in a serious, humorous or fancy manner.</p>

                                <p>Policy Rationale</p>

                                <p>We do not allow content that sexually exploits or endangers children. When we become
                                    aware of apparent child exploitation, we report it to the National Center for
                                    Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), in compliance with applicable law. We know
                                    that sometimes people share nude images of their own children with good intentions;
                                    however, we generally remove these images because of the potential for abuse by
                                    others and to help avoid the possibility of other people reusing or misappropriating
                                    the images.</p>

                                <p>We also work with external experts, including the GOPY Safety Advisory Board, to
                                    discuss and improve our policies and enforcement around online safety issues,
                                    especially with regard to children. Learn more about the technology we’re using to

                                <p>Policy Rationale</p>

                                <p>We recognize the importance of GOPY as a place to discuss and draw attention to
                                    sexual violence and exploitation. We believe this plays an important role in
                                    building communities and mutual understanding. In an effort to create a space for
                                    conversation around the issue while promoting a safe environment, we will remove
                                    content that describes, threatens or promotes violence, abuse or sexual
                                    exploitation. In addition, we will create a space for victims to share their
                                    experiences. We will remove content that displays, endorses, or mediates sexual
                                    activities with dissenting people or prostitution services, such as prostitution and
                                    sexual partner services. We do this to avoid facilitating transactions that may
                                    involve trafficking, compulsion and forced sexual activity.</p>

                                <p>To protect victims and survivors, we also removed images depicting sexual violence
                                    and intimate images that were shared without the person's consent. We have presented
                                    in writing the technology we use to suppress intimate images as well as the research
                                    we take as the basis of our operations. We have also compiled a guide to reporting
                                    and removing intimate photos shared without your permission.</p>

                                <p>Do not post:</p>

                                <p>In instances where content consists of any form of non-consensual sexual touching,
                                    crushing, necrophilia or bestiality,or forced stripping, including:</p>

                                <p>Depictions (including real photos/videos), or</p>

                                <p>Advocacy (including aspirational and conditional statements), or</p>

                                <p>Person in the image is (near) nude, engaged in sexual activity, or in a sexual pose
                                </p>

                                    media (for example, leak of images confirmed by media)</p>

                                <p>Policy Rationale</p>

                                <p>Bullying and harassment happen in many places and come in many different forms, from
                                    making threats to releasing personally identifiable information, to sending
                                    threatening messages, and making unwanted malicious contact. We do not tolerate this
                                    kind of behavior because it prevents people from feeling safe and respected on GOPY.
                                </p>

                                <p>We distinguish between public figures and private individuals because we want to
                                    allow discussion, which often includes critical commentary of people who are
                                    featured in the news or who have a large public audience. For public figures, we
                                    remove attacks that are severe as well as certain attacks where the public figure is
                                    directly tagged in the post or comment. For private individuals, our protection goes
                                    further: we remove content that's meant to degrade or shame, including, for example,
                                    claims about someone's sexual activity. We recognize that bullying and harassment
                                    can have more of an emotional impact on minors, which is why our policies provide
                                    heightened protection for users between the ages of 13 and 18.</p>

                                <p>Context and intent matter, and we allow people to post and share if it is clear that
                                    something was shared in order to condemn or draw attention to bullying and
                                    harassment. In certain instances, we require self-reporting because it helps us
                                    understand that the person targeted feels bullied or harassed. In addition to
                                    reporting such behavior and content, we encourage people to use tools available on
                                    GOPY to help protect against it.</p>

                                <p>We also have a Bullying Prevention Hub, which is a resource for teens, parents, and
                                    educators seeking support for issues related to bullying and other conflicts. It
                                    offers step-by-step guidance, including information on how to start important
                                    conversations about bullying.</p>

                                <h4 id="Hatespeech">1. Hate speech </h4>

                                <p>Policy Rationale</p>

                                <p>We don’t allow hate speech on GOPY because it creates an environment of intimidation
                                    and exclusion; and in some cases may promote offline violence. </p>

                                <p>We define hate speech as a direct attack against people on the basis of what we call
                                    protected characteristics: race, ethnicity, national origin, disability, religious
                                    affiliation, caste, sexual orientation, sex, gender identity and serious disease. We
                                    also protect refugees, migrants, immigrants and asylum seekers from the most severe
                                    attacks, though we do allow commentary and criticism of immigration policies. We
                                    define aggression as violent or degrading language, insults, calls for exclusion or
                                    isolation. We divide aggression into three levels of severity as described below.
                                </p>

                                <p>We recognize that people sometimes share content that includes someone else’s hate
                                    speech to condemn it or raise awareness. In other cases, speech that might otherwise
                                    violate our standards can be used self-referentially or in an empowering way. At
                                    times, people show their anger when feelings are broken. On other occasions, they
                                    use gender-specific language to control membership in a health or active support
                                    group, such as a women-only breastfeeding group. Our policies are designed to allow
                                    room for these types of speech, but we require people to clearly indicate their
                                    intent. If intention is unclear, we may remove content.</p>

                                <p>Besides, people can write funny and social comments related to these topics. In
                                    addition, we believe that when using real identities, people are more responsible
                                    when sharing this type of comment.</p>

                                <p>Policy Rationale</p>

                                <p>We remove content that glorifies violence or celebrates the suffering or humiliation
                                    of others because it may create an environment that discourages participation. We
                                    allow graphic content (with some limitations) to help people raise awareness about
                                    issues. We know that people value the ability to discuss important issues like human
                                    rights abuses or acts of terrorism. We also know that people have different
                                    sensitivities with regard to graphic and violent content. For that reason, we add a
                                    warning label to especially graphic or violent content so that it is not available
                                    to people under the age of eighteen and so that people are aware of the graphic or
                                    violent nature before they click to see it.</p>

                                <p>Policy Rationale</p>

                                <p>We restrict the display of nudity or sexual activity because some people in our
                                    community may be sensitive to this type of content. Additionally, we default to
                                    removing sexual imagery to prevent the sharing of non-consensual or underage
                                    content. Restrictions on the display of sexual activity also apply to digitally
                                    created content unless it is posted for educational, humorous, or satirical
                                    purposes.</p>

                                <p>Our nudity policies have become more nuanced over time. We understand that nudity can
                                    be shared for a variety of reasons, including as a form of protest, to raise
                                    awareness about a cause, or for educational or medical reasons. Where such intent is
                                    clear, we make allowances for the content. For example, while we restrict some
                                    images of female breasts that include the nipple, we allow other images, including
                                    those depicting acts of protest, women actively engaged in breast-feeding, and
                                    photos of post-mastectomy scarring. For images depicting visible genitalia or the
                                    anus in the context of birth and after-birth moments or health-related situations we
                                    include a warning label so that people are aware that the content may be sensitive.
                                    We also allow photographs of paintings, sculptures, and other art that depicts nude
                                    figures. </p>

                                <p>Do not post: </p>

                                    cancer or disease prevention/assessment)</p>

                                <p>Visible anus and/or fully nude close-ups of buttocks unless photoshopped on a public

                                <p>Policy Rationale</p>

                                <p>As noted in Section 8 of our Community Guidelines (Sexual Exploitation of Adults),
                                    people use GOPY to discuss and draw attention to sexual violence and exploitation.
                                    We recognize the importance of and want to allow for this discussion. We draw the
                                    line, however, when content facilitates, encourages or coordinates sexual encounters
                                    or commercial sexual services between adults such as prostitution or escort
                                    services. We also restrict sexually explicit language that may lead to solicitation
                                    because some audiences within our global community may be sensitive to this type of
                                    content and it may impede the ability for people to connect with their friends and
                                    the broader community.</p>

                                <p>Do not post:</p>

                                    and implies or indirectly offers/request for sexual solicitation.</p>

                                <p>For example, content would not be infringing if it was a hand-drawn image depicting

                                    what we call cruel and insensitive content. We define it as content that targets
                                    victims of serious physical or emotional harm.</p>

                                    distracts from people's ability to engage authentically in online communities. We
                                    don't allow people to use false or inaccurate information to collect likes,

                                    responsible for their words and actions when they use their real identities. That's
                                    why we ask people to connect on GOPY by the name they use in their daily lives. Our
                                    authentication policy aims to create a safe environment where people can trust and
                                    hold others accountable.</p>

                                    fine line between false news and satire or opinion. For these reasons, we don't
                                    remove false news from GOPY but instead, significantly reduce its distribution by
                                    showing it lower in the News Feed.</p>

                                <p>We are working to build a more informed community and reduce the spread of false news
                                    in a number of different ways, namely by</p>

                                <p>Using various signals, including feedback from our community, to inform a machine
                                    learning model that predicts which stories may be false</p>

                                <p>Reducing the distribution of content rated as false by independent third-party
